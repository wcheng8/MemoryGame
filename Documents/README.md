###Scope & Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a memory card game to gauge an individuals memory ability whilst having fun. This game will help solve the need of purchasing actual cards to play a memory game on. The target audience for this application would be anyone who wants to train their visual memory, and have fun while doing it. The typical person would play the game to see how fast they can complete the memory puzzle and how many attempts they take to do it. The less attempts the better! The individual would first select a card from the listed deck, by choosing the numbers on top of each card. This would open up the card and reveal the alphabet underneath. The user then chooses a second card to flip over, this will open up the second card and check if the letters of both cards match. If the alphabets of the first card and the second card match, the cards will remain open, and you will be prompted to select another pair, until all cards are flipped open. If they do not match, the cards will flip back over to the original position revealing the number on the card and you will be prompted to select another card. This game is a fun way of training your visual memory and having fun at the same time. The game can be played multiple times, and the cards would automatically shuffle and be placed in a different location. The matching letters are also randomized, simulating a real deck of cards. An alternative purpose of this game, would just to have fun and test you memory and luck to see how many attempts you would need to solve the 8 card memory game challenge. This could be then compared with others, to see how many attempts they would need to solve the challenge. 

###Features
Feature1: The ability to shuffle the cards to give randomized matches each play.
When the user selects all the matches in the current game, the user is prompted with a different game with a set number of matches with a randomized location on the board. This way the same game will not be repeated more than once and would allow the user to play the game again but with different card locations. 

Feature2: The ability to flip open the first card and second and keep it open if it is a match.
When the first and the second card is flipped over and matches. The matching cards would remain open, and you will be allowed to select a different pair of cards in the terminal until all matches are found and you beat the game! If the cards are not matches, the cards would close on the next attempt and the user would be prompted to select cards out of the cards on the screen.

Feature3: The ability to select cards within the deck board without selecting open cards
The cards on the deck board can be selected by the number ontop of the card. By selecting the number on the card in the terminal. This would flip over the card and reveal the alphabet underneath. If the card has already been flipped over, either it was selected previously if you are selecting the second card or you are selecting from a card that has already been flipped over. Then an error would arise and would ask the user to input another card that has not been flipped over. This would be the same if a string was inputed, or a number outside the card range.

###UI/UX Outline
The user will interact with the game on the terminal. The user will select a card by selecting the number indicated on the back of the card. This would then flip the card over and reveal the alphabet underneath. A second card will then be selected with the number on the back of the card. The user will need to select a card that is not a match or has not been selected previously, else the user will be asked for another input. If the user selects a string, special character or a number outside the range of the cards available, the user will be prompted to select correct card input.

###Control Flow Diagram



###Implementation Plan
- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

R10	Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.

You must include:
- steps to install the application
- any dependencies required by the application to operate
- any system/hardware requirements
